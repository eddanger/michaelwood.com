It's been a while since I updated my website. The last time I did so I didn't have children, lived in Vancouver and the website was written in PHP.
I thought it would be a good opportunity to dust off the cobwebs and update this staple of my online life. Perhaps I'll write a few blog posts, upload some interesting things, or cogitate about things happening around me. Maybe I'll learn new words, and maybe you will too!
In fact, I am not too sure what I am going to put on this website. Hopefully whatever I'll do it will be updated more frequently and provide you, my loyal reader, with minutes of enjoyment.

Also, happy birthday to me! This is my gift to you. Enjoy!

For the geeky ones out there, this website is open-source. Take a look at my [source code][michaelwood.com-gh] and let me know if you find any typos or invalid do-hickeys.

          Yes, yes it is! I was looking through my photo library for an appropriate image, maybe a cake, or a birthday present... but I found this. I don't think there is a better way to announce the return of my website than with a bacon donut.
