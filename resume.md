# PROFILE

Since my early days I have always wanted to build things whether it be Lego, play forts or intricate architectural drawings. When the the World Wide Web came to be I took that passion and started to build web sites which eventually expanded to building internet products and services. Wanting to pursue a career in the high technology sector I attended Simon Fraser University for Computer Science and went on to be part of several Web 1.0 startups. Learning is a life-long quest for me and I continue to keep up to date with current technologies, tools and services. I have driven new business practices and processes in the my organizations and am passionate about methodologies that help drive productivity.  I have a strong desire to learn as well as support and mentor those on my team to help them level-up.
